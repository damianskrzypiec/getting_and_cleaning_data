Project for course "Getting and cleaning data".

R scrpit "run_analysis.R" will work correctly if and only if you have extracted samsung data in your
working directory.

Steps:

1. Merging "train" and "test" data sets in one data frame
2. Extracting only measurements that depends on mean or standrad deviation
3. Setting descriptive activity names
4. Setting right names for variables
5. Creating tidy data frame with means for each subjects and each activities from previous data

The last data frame is tidy, beacuse every row descrive different observation, every variable have distinct column and there are no missing values
